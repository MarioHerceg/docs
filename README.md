# Memgraph Docs

This repository contains the source files and various generators for the
Memgraph documentation available at
[memgraph.com/docs](https://memgraph.com/docs). Since we are writing our
technical documentation using markdown, it is also nicely rendered by
github as you can see by following
[this link](https://github.com/memgraph/docs/tree/master/user_technical).
