## Other Features

The following sections describe some of the other supported features.

### UNWIND

The `UNWIND` clause is used to unwind a list of values as individual rows.

Example. Produce rows out of a single list.

```opencypher
UNWIND [1,2,3] AS listElement RETURN listElement
```

### String Operators

Apart from comparison and concatenation operators openCypher provides special
string operators for easier matching of substrings:

Operator           | Description
-------------------|------------
 `a STARTS WITH b` | Returns true if prefix of string a is equal to string b.
 `a ENDS WITH b`   | Returns true if suffix of string a is equal to string b.
 `a CONTAINS b`    | Returns true if some substring of string a is equal to string b.

### Parameters

When automating the queries for Memgraph, it comes in handy to change only
some parts of the query. Usually, these parts are values which are used for
filtering results or similar, while the rest of the query remains the same.

Parameters allow reusing the same query, but with different parameter values.
The syntax uses the `$` symbol to designate a parameter name. We don't allow
old Cypher parameter syntax using curly braces. For example, you can parameterize
filtering a node property:

```opencypher
MATCH (node1 {property: $propertyValue}) RETURN node1
```

You can use parameters instead of any literal in the query, but not instead of
property maps even though that is allowed in standard openCypher. Following
example is illegal in Memgraph:

```opencypher
MATCH (node1 $propertyValue) RETURN node1
```

To use parameters with Python driver use following syntax:

```python
session.run('CREATE (alice:Person {name: $name, age: $ageValue}',
            name='Alice', ageValue=22)).consume()
```

To use parameters which names are integers you will need to wrap parameters in
a dictionary and convert them to strings before running a query:

```python
session.run('CREATE (alice:Person {name: $0, age: $1}',
            {'0': "Alice", '1': 22})).consume()
```

To use parameters with some other driver please consult appropriate
documentation.

### CASE

Conditional expressions can be expressed in openCypher language by simple and
generic form of `CASE` expression. A simple form is used to compare an expression
against multiple predicates. For the first matched predicate result of the
expression provided after the `THEN` keyword is returned.  If no expression is
matched value following `ELSE` is returned is provided, or `null` if `ELSE` is not
used:

```opencypher
MATCH (n)
RETURN CASE n.currency WHEN "DOLLAR" THEN "$" WHEN "EURO" THEN "â‚¬" ELSE "UNKNOWN" END
```

In generic form, you don't need to provide an expression whose value is compared to
predicates, but you can list multiple predicates and the first one that evaluates
to true is matched:

```opencypher
MATCH (n)
RETURN CASE WHEN n.height < 30 THEN "short" WHEN n.height > 300 THEN "tall" END
```

### Inspecting queries

Before a Cypher query is executed, it is converted into an internal form
suitable for execution, known as a *plan*. A plan is a tree-like data structure
describing a pipeline of operations which will be performed on the database in
order to yield the results for a given query. Every node within a plan is known
as a *logical operator* and describes a particular operation.

Because a plan represents a pipeline, the logical operators are iteratively
executed as data passes from one logical operator to the other. Every logical
operator *pulls* data from the logical operator(s) preceeding it, processes it
and passes it onto the logical operator next in the pipeline for further
processing.

Using the `EXPLAIN` operator, it is possible for the user to inspect the
produced plan and gain insight into the execution of a query. Currently, the
various logical operators aren't fully documented as their behavior is subject
to change. However, the behavior of most of them can be deduced from their name.
In the future, additional information might be added to the output of the
`EXPLAIN` operator.

As an example, let's inspect the plan produced for a simple query:

```opencypher
EXPLAIN MATCH (n) RETURN n;
```

```plaintext
+----------------+
| QUERY PLAN     |
+----------------+
|  * Produce {n} |
|  * ScanAll (n) |
|  * Once        |
+----------------+
```

The output of the `EXPLAIN` query is a representation of the produced plan. Every
logical operator within the plan starts with an asterisk character (`*`) and is
followed by its name (and sometimes additional information). The execution of
the query proceeds iteratively (generating one entry of the result set at a
time), with data flowing from the bottom-most logical operator(s) (the start of
the pipeline) to the top-most logical operator(s) (the end of the pipeline).

In the example above, the resulting plan is a pipeline of 3 logical operators.
`Once` is the identity logical operator which does nothing and is always found
at the start of the pipeline; `ScanAll` is a logical operator which iteratively
produces all of the nodes in the graph; and `Produce` is a logical operator
which takes data produced by another logical operator and produces data for the
query's result set.

A slightly more complicated example would be:

```opencypher
EXPLAIN MATCH (n :Node)-[:Edge]-(m :Node) WHERE n.prop = 42 RETURN *;
```

```plaintext
+--------------------------------+
| QUERY PLAN                     |
+--------------------------------+
|  * Produce {m, n}              |
|  * Filter                      |
|  * Expand (m)-[anon1:Edge]-(n) |
|  * ScanAllByLabel (n :Node)    |
|  * ScanAllByLabel (m :Node)    |
|  * Once                        |
+--------------------------------+
```

In this example, the `Filter` logical operator is used to filter the matched
nodes because of the `WHERE n.prop = 42` construct. The `Expand` logical
operator is used to find an edge between two nodes, in this case `m` and `n`
which were matched previously using the `ScanAllByLabel` logical operator (a
variant of the `ScanAll` logical operator mentioned previously).

The execution of the query proceeds iteratively as follows. First, two vertices
of type `:Node` are found as the result of the two scans. Then, we try to find a
path that consists of the two vertices and an edge between them. If a path is
found, it is further filtered based on a property of one of the vertices.
Finally, if the path satisfied the filter, its two vertices are added to the
query's result set.

A simple example showcasing the fully general tree structure of the plan could
be:

```opencypher
EXPLAIN MERGE (n) RETURN n;
```

```plaintext
+------------------+
| QUERY PLAN       |
+------------------+
|  * Produce {n}   |
|  * Accumulate    |
|  * Merge         |
|  |\ On Match     |
|  | * ScanAll (n) |
|  | * Once        |
|  |\ On Create    |
|  | * CreateNode  |
|  | * Once        |
|  * Once          |
+------------------+
```

The `Merge` logical operator (constructed as a result of the `MERGE` construct)
can take input from upto 3 places. The `On Match` and `On Create` branches are
"pulled from" only if a match was found or if a new vertex has to be created,
respectively.

### Profiling queries

Along with inspecting a query's plan as described in the [previous
section](#inspecting-queries), it is also possible to profile the execution of a
query and get a detailed report on how the query's plan behaved. For every
logical operator the following info is provided:

- `ACTUAL HITS` --- the number of times a particular logical operator was pulled
  from.

- `RELATIVE TIME` --- the amount of time that was spent processing a particular
  logical operator, relative to the execution of the whole plan.

- `ABSOLUTE TIME` --- the amount of time that was spent processing a particular
  logical operator.

A simple example to illustrate the output:

```opencypher
EXPLAIN MATCH (n :Node)-[:Edge]-(m :Node) WHERE n.prop = 42 RETURN *;
```

```plaintext
+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
| OPERATOR      | ACTUAL HITS   | RELATIVE TIME | ABSOLUTE TIME |
+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
| * Produce     | 1             |   7.134628 %  |   0.003949 ms |
| * Filter      | 1             |  12.734765 %  |   0.007049 ms |
| * Expand      | 1             |   5.181460 %  |   0.002868 ms |
| * ScanAll     | 1             |   3.325061 %  |   0.001840 ms |
| * ScanAll     | 1             |  71.061241 %  |   0.039334 ms |
| * Once        | 2             |   0.562844 %  |   0.000312 ms |
+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
